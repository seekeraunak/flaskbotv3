The default password to change the Perf factor is "ARM". This default password can be changed through the APF (Airline Policy File) for aircraft fitted with Legacy FMS1, or through the AMI software for aircraft fitted with FMS2. As APF is part of Navigation Database you will have to request this password change to Aviation Services Team ( aviationservices@honeywell.com ) if you use a Legacy FMS1. That is more simple and cheaper than modify the AMI which is modified via AMI Production Team ( AMIproduction@Honeywell.com ), they can quote that change in your AMI if you are using Pegasus FMS2. Please check in your aircraft manuals. When contacting aviation Services, please make sure that the header for APF matches it the right A/C type, so specify all aircraft type and model and MSN in which you want to change the password. I believe you can have different APF header and APF file in a same NDB, but please confirm with Aviation Services. If you contact AMI Production Team, please inform the current AMI part number that your fleet is using.
