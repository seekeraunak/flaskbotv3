Current A380 FMS S/W (L2 and L2.1) does not support Missed Approach procedures which are coded separately from the primary approach procedure. Loading a NavDB which contains separately coded Missed Approach "Z" type procedures can result in the Missed Approach procedure being incorrectly strung by the FMS. This behaviour has been seen on A380 NavDB which use LIDO source data. A380 NavDBs which use Jeppesen source data are not affected. The solution is to code the NavDB without separate Missed Approach procedures (i.e. Primary and Missed Approach procedure merged).
