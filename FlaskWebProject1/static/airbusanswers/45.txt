The Position Update function is very “dangerous” in that the flight crew has no FMC check on his input if he makes a mistake with his entry. The FMC accepts the pilots input as a valid position bias correction without any reasonableness check – so that is why it is still HIGH accuracy. The assumption was that the flight crew would be doing the update on the ground at a location whose Present Position is well known. The aircraft ECAM FM/GPS DISAGREE message is therefore important and should be emphasized. The FMC will treat the GPS position like a valid radio position so there should be a gradual reduction of the position bias to the “correct” value. However if the position bias is very large then this correction could take a very long time.
