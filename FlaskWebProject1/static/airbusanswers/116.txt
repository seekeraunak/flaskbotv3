Change in the loader was implemented by Airbus with NSS 2B.    Airbus has verified the AMI will not load if the ‘User Defined Data’ field is not empty into the FILES.LUM and/or into the LOADS.LUM. The uploading won’t work on pEIS2b A/C.   After NSS 2B introduction, a manual workaround was used to put media in compliance with last loader generation onboard the A/C. This “manual” process was aiming at providing immediate help to A380 customers that needed AMI urgently (at A/C delivery). We are currently working on automatic steps implementation to generate media in compliance with latest A380 A/C equipment. This will prevent problem to occur again.
