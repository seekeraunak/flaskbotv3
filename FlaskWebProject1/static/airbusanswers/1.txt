From an FMS standpoint, Trans Altitude or FL comes coded value in NAVDB for the concerned airport - e.g Trans ALT (resp FL) associated with departure (resp. Destination) airport entered in the flight plan. As mentioned before It is part of the published data so I believe the NAVDB just gather what is published through approved NAV DB Source. When there is no defined value, Trans ALT or FL remains invalid. 
There is no re-allocation based on Alt constraint and the re-assignment of TRANS FL or ALT exists when the arrival procedure (or departure) specifies a Trans Alt Â different than the one coded for the airport. In such a case, the highest altitude is kept. There should be no cost associated and no particular change for all FMSs and NavDB processing.
