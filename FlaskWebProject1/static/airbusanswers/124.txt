On the latest A318/319/320/321 aircrafts, the MDDU (Multipurpose Disk Drive Unit) is no longer present in the cockpit. Airbus has chosen the Teledyne PMAT2000 for all upload procedures and consequently removed the MDDU. In order to download the Pegasus FMS BITE, the PMAT2000 and the same specific floppy disk can be used. Airbus updated the Aircraft Maintenance Manuel (AMM) accordingly. The corresponding AMM task is 22-70-00-610-006-I - Downloading of the FM Data.   Here below the Airbus procedure once the PMAT is connected: - Open C/B 10CA1 & 10CA2 - On the overhead panel, on the Data Loading Selector (DLS) set the switch to ON - On the DLS push the PREV or NEXT key until FMGC1 is displayed - Push the SEL CTL key - Close C/B 10CA1 (power-up test of FMGC1 starts; finishes with triple click aural warning) - Put the FM BITE DOWNLOAD TOOL (F1420060) into the disk drive - Wait for the "download complete" message - Open the C/B 10CA1   The same procedure applies for FMGC2 but DO NOT USE THE SAME FLOPPY DISK to download 2 FMGCs!   Note: the Airbus procedure is not attached as it is proprietary information
