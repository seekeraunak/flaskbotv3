Basically the FMS NEEDS to consider the SAME magnetic declination used by the Navigation charts when flying procedures. This is achieved by the use of the magnetic declination of the recommended Nav Aid associated to a leg. (the recommended navaid being mentioned in the navigation database for a procedure leg).   Example: If the A/C is flying the approach TOTO onto a CF leg, this leg has a recommended Nav Aid associated to it  in the Navigation Data Base. The FMS will use the MAG DEC associated with this recommended Nav Aid, (also in the NDB), to define the correct Magetic course for display and guidance.   The use of the FMS MAG VAR table occurs only when the recommended Nav Aid does not have a magnetic dec associated to it (DME, TACAN for example).   Note also that the industry tries to have common approach to solve this magnetic declination reference discrepancy. This is one of the intents of DO236A that asks to consider the magnetic declination of the airport associated to the procedure as reference for magnetic declination. Pegasus Step1A is NOT per DO236A so far (A380 FMS is …)   The internal MAG VAR table of the FMS (now independently loadable on step1A) is updated every 5 years (typically model 2005 optimized for 2010).
