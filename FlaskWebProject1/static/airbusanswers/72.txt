The password to use to modify the Perf Factor is contained in the APF file. The APF file is included in the Nav DB. The APF is made of a header that contain the A/C type. If the A/C type is not the correct one (This could be obviously the case if the airline uses the same NDB for all their Airbus A/C), the operator can not modify the PErf Factor where as the password is the good one. However all the other data of the Nav DB can be used; To solve the problem it is necessary to have the correct A/C type defined in the APF file.
