The coordinates come from the NavDB. While it is possible to code an uplink fix as a Lat/Lon, this is rarely used. In virtually all cases a fix IDENT is uplinked and this has no associated positional data per se. The FM uses the IDENT to search the NavDB and get the appropriate position. Problems can occur when the IDENT is duplicated in the NavDB - the logic to handle this depends on the FM type being used.
