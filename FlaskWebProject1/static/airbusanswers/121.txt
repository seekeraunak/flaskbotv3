CONSEQUENCE : FM1 simple reset (no flight plan/data loss) with "MAP NOT AVAIL" message displayed on CAPT ND, and "AUTO FLT FM 1 FAULT" ECAM message associated with "NAV GPWS TERR DET FAULT". INVESTIGATION STATUS : Laboratory tests allowed to reproduce the reported event and to find the root cause. The cause is a FM misbehaviour which occurs only when the crossload function is used during a FM software upload (NDB, OPC, AMI, etc.). MITIGATION / INTERIM PLAN : The following workaround avoid the occurrence of the reported event. If the crossloading function is used, it is necessary, at the end of the related AMM task 22-70-00-610-807 to reset twice the FM 1 and FM2 C/ B. The AMM task 22-70-00-610-807 has been updated accordingly and its revision is already available. MAINTENANCE INFORMATION: When using the crossload function, we recommend to follow the instruction provided in the updated AMM task 22-70-00- 610-807. OPS INFORMATION : FCOM PRO-SUP-22-10 - FMGS Reset and Other Abnormal Procedures - Other Abnormal Procedures REPERCUSSION ON A/C DISPATCH : N/A PERMANENT OR FINAL SOLUTION : This issue will be addressed in the next Honeywell FMS2 standard for A330/A340 aircraft, so-called "Release 1A" (R1A) available under RFC/RMO process. To date, Honeywell R1A standard 'P4' is targeted to be available by Q4 2012 for A330 PW/RR aircraft (MOD 57545), Q1 2013 for A330 GE aricraft (MOD 57544), and Q3 2013 for A340- 500/600 aircraft (MOD 202095). For A340-200/300 aircraft, certification is not launched pending RFC/RMO.
