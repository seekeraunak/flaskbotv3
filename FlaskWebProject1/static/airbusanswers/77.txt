The Pegasus FMS Step 1 on Single Aisle and P1,P2, P3 has a problem to auto string the EO SID when both normal procedures (SID and STAR) and extended procedures are defined for a Runway/Airport. In such a case, if the EOSID is defined in the extended file (because it includes an RF leg) and if normal procedure exists, the FMS is not able to retrieve the EOSID as an Engine Out SID. The workaround to propose for such departure is to create a secondary flight plan with the EOSID selected as normal SID and to display the SEC flight plan on the MCDU to have both active and secondary flight plan displayed on the ND. If an Engine Out occurs, the pilot has to Pull the FCU Heading knob and activate the secondary flight plan to have the EOSID strung in the active flight plan.
