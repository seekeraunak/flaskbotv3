The route was not uplink completely and there were route discontinuity on waypoint RUSSO and NERTI
We investigated that the reason why there was route discontinuity on these 2 waypoints because FMS has a logic that if the FMS NavDB contains 2 waypoints of the same name in this case RUSSO and NERTI
it requires the waypoint Latitude and LONgitude to be uplinked as well so that the FMS can differentiate the waypoint for the flight plan
