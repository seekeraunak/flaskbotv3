When the "Computed Reserve in Flight" (AMI item 2.1.5.b) is set to Disabled that field is blanked at take-off so it is not viewable or modifiable in Flight. If the option is Enabled then the Crew can modify the Fuel settings for RTE RSV in Flight however the limitations are taken from the Upper Limit (AMI item 2.1.2) and Lower Limit (AMI item 2.1.3) settings established in the AMI values during AMI definition. This is not clear from the AMI reference document given to operators as a tool when selecting their definitions.
