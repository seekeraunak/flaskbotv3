With the introduction of new media for Ethernet high speed load (A615A), new Part Numbers have been introduced (HNPXX-XXXX-XXXX) for FMS software. Those part numbers are mandated by ARINC 665 Specification. These P/Ns are embedded in the ARINC 665 Media and Load headers and refer to ARINC 665 parts and not to the software contained in those parts. They are referenced as CD-ROM PNs in the attached file since they are indeed associated with CD-ROM media   Before ARINC 665, for floppy disk media, the same P/N (PSXXXXXXX-XXX) was used for media, the software on it and the image of that software (load).   With the ARINC 665 CD it is possible to have multiple ARINC 665 Loads contained in the ARINC 665 Media and it is required to separate part numbers to refer to the media (media),  to each piece of software contained on the media (in-memory software), and to each of the ARINC 665-format loadable images (load).   As a result, several P/Ns refer to the same Product Software loaded into the FMS (and displayed on MCDU page). Customers can refer to the attached cross-reference matrix to quickly identify the different PNs associated to a same Product Software for Pegasus FMS.
