The reason why there was route discontinuity on these 2 waypoints because FMS has a logic that if the FMS NavDB contains 2 waypoints of the same name (in this case RUSSO and NERTI), it requires the waypoint LAT/LON to be uplinked as well so that the FMS can differentiate the waypoint for the flight plan. Unfortunately, there is no way to do this way. For duplicate waypoints in the Navigation database, if the LAT/LONG are not mentioned the ident are rejected an discontinuity is strung instead. The FMS works per Airbus specification.
