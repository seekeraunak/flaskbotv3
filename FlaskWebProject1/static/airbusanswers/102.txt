When the predicted EFOB at the destination becomes smaller than the MIN DEST FOB entry, then the EFOB is displayed in amber on the MCDU. As with most indications like this there is a hysteresis of 200kg to revert back to green. So it is possible to have a MIN DEST FOB that is lower than the EFOB but is still displayed in amber. As there is no EFOB comparison between Airbus FM's. The comparison is done on actual Gross Weight â€“ if this differs between FM's by more than 2 Metric Tonnes then an MCDU scratchpad message is produced.
