One operator asked how could they verify the contents of the FMS AMI of their A320’s. All their A319/A320/A321 airplanes had FM Operational software Step 1A P/N: PS4087600-903.   There are 2 main ways to define customization at FM level:   - OPC which is controlled by Airbus and Operator. It reflects operational option and A/C installation. - AMI which is a set of FM software option defined by the operator.   You can print the FMS AMI contents by performing the following actions in the aircraft’s Multipurpose Control and Display Unit (MCDU):   NOTE 1: Before performing any kind of work in the airplane, firstly read the airplane’s AMM in order to know how to get the system pages in the MCDU.   NOTE 2: The information described below is for information only. Any task performed in the aircraft has to be done according to the airplane’s AMM.   - In the MCDU Main Menu page, p ush the line key adjacent to FMGC. - In the FMGC page, p ush the line key adjacent to SOFTWARE STATUS/XLOAD. - In the P/N XLOAD page, p ush the line key adjacent to NEXT PAGE and cycle the pages until you find the FM AIRLINE CONFIG page. - In the FM AIRLINE CONFIG page, p ush the line key adjacent to PRINT. - Get the print of the FMS AMI (FM AIRLINE CONFIG) in the cockpit’s printer. - Return to the MCDU Main Menu page.   NOTE 3: The printing capability of AMI and OPC exists on both A320 and A330/A340 Step1A. However Step1A on LR is optional and only a few number of customers have it at the moment.
