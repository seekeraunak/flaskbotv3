MORA (Minimum Off Route Altitude) values and Grid are a part of NAV DB 424 AIRAC update which occurs every 28 days. It can be defined as values on customer flight plans in order to provide aircrew with important obstacle clearance information, in the event that the flight should deviate from its planned path. It has nothing to do with EGPWS Terrain database and its display. Definition is: The Grid MORA provides terrain and obstruction clearance within the section outlined by latitude and longitude blocks provided in the Starting Latitude and Starting Longitude. The source data for the MORA data is primarily the state or data supplier (e.g Lido, Jeppesen, Navtech) additionally that are US defense Mapping Agency and the NASA. . Within the NavDB,  a grid MORA is a square of 1° LAT, 1°Long. MORA values will depend on the length of the particular leg as it can be as short as one grid space or long enough to cross several grid spaces. If the leg crosses more than one grid space, the highest grid MORA will be displayed on the computed flight plan. The search area of a leg is a 5 nm radius (or 10 nm diameter) on either side of the airway. Due to the improved navigation in today’s aircraft, this distance has been reduced from a radius of 10 nm (or a diameter of 20 nm). Grid MORA values clear all terrain and obstructions by 1000 feet in areas where the highest elevations are 5000 MSL or lower. MORA values clear all terrain by 2000 feet in areas where the highest elevations are 5001 feet MSL or higher. The field will contain values expressed in hundreds of feet (e.g. 060 = 6000 feet) and for geographical sections that are not surveyed UNK (unknown) alpha characters.
