Codes 0315 & 0317 indicate the FM battery in a given FMGC is low voltage and will no longer power the SRAM memory when the A/C is shut down at the end of the day. Code 0315 is for battery 1, 0317 for battery 2 and 0319 for both batteries. To avoid this situation monitoring the PFR for Class 1 failures is the key. The second battery will maintain the content of the SRAM until maintenance can be performed. The FM is designed such that the batteries should not fail together. When one battery fails maintenance of the FMGC can be planned so an AOG situation should not occur.
