This is not an issue. Example:  Pilot reported a discrepancy of 1º in course between what is the official information from the Finish AIP (and Route Manual) and what is loaded on the aircraft's FMS.  In particular, while flying the DIVAM 1B STAR it was noticed a route course of 40º between fixes HK803 and HK801, whereas the Finish AIP states a route course of 39º. The Magnetic course defined for approach/runway is 39 as per the chart. Considering magnetic declination in the area about 8° east (HTV Navaid used for the procedure with 04L runway). So the true course for the Approach will be 39+8 = 47° True. For TF legs FMS use the lat/long of the fixes to build the path and computes the True outbound course. FMS then convert True track between fixes in Magnetic reference for display on MCDU flight plan page. To achieve this, the FMS use its own MAG VAR table and consider the True track value + the magnetic variation. Issue can be seen on old Legacy FMS that has MAG VAR table hard coded into the FMS and doesn`t have updated values of Mag Var. Thus, FMS uses old values of Mag VAR and explain the discrepancy. It can also been observed each time the magnetic declination of the navaid used for the published procedure differs than the local one computed by the FMS (Navaid could have be calibrated several years ago). However this limitation affects only the display on MCDU flight plan page. The path computed by the FMS remains correct since it is based on fixes and not on course.
