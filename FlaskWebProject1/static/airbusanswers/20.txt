No, technically, such doumentation being requested should come from Airbus, not Honeywell FYI: The FAA's position is that IRU only operation is far more accurate than IRU with DME/DME and has requested operators to disable the mode for DME/DME updating. Honeywell's position DME/DME accuracy is certified to meet RNP 1. If DME/DME is available, it is sufficient for a missed approach of RNP 1. After loss of GPS, for a period of time of a few minutes, IRS will be more accurate than DME/DME. There are theoretical/certified and practical values for this time. Use of DME/DME does require an infrastructure verification that IRS only does not have.
