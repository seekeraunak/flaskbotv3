PKI certificate is a specific file (with a .LSH extension) that is embedded in the CD-Rom that will be sent to the airlines for any software loading (OPS, OPC, AMI, NDB, PDB, MAG VAR DB). This is a shf (secured header file). When a CD-Rom is prepared to be sent to the airlines with any software, this file (PKI) will be systematically added in the CR-Rom. It is CRC-linked to the loadable element that is embedded in the CD-Rom. The aim is to avoid any data change if the CD is stolen by anybody (who could change data and give it back to the customer). On the aircraft side, the DLCS (data loader) system is going to compute CRC and check that all these CRCs are compatible with the content of this PKI file. This is a requirement by AIRBUS and the A380 loader will look for this signature to be present before it will upload any software.
