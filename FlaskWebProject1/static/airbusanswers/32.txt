The 4/ 6 year life is the installed life of the battery and includes the time it is overridden by the external DC voltage. It includes the shelf life prior to installation which is limited to 1 year. As noted from the CMM, there are 2 batteries with different discharge rates. The intent is to allow the slower discharging battery to sustain memory after the faster discharging battery has dropped below the "valid" threshold.
