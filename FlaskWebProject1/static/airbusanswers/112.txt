The NDB size depends on the FM software inside the Pegasus FMGEC (the hardware is the same 4084070-90X) There are 3 releases of FMS for FMGEC 4087700-901 (called P1) and 4087700-902 (called P2) have a 2 Mwords/ 4 Mbytes capability for Navigation database (16 bits words) 4087700-903 (called P3) has a 2.75Mwords/5.5 MBytes capability Find below some details on the NDB format The capability is the basic configuration, there is nothing to activate on A/C or at FMG(E )C level. However note that the 5.5 Mbyte limit is a theoretical maximum limit considering that all the possible elements of the Navigation Database exist and have reached their maximum number (max number of waypoints, airports ...) Indeed, the number of some elements of the NDB are limited by the size of the hash tables. The hash tables are a data structure designed to improve the efficiency of the EFIS Navigation Display rate for Airports, navaids, NDB and waypoints. One option exists to increase the number of Enroute waypoints. The option that exist consists in removing the Terminal waypoints from the hash tables so as to increase the number of enroute waypoints or airports. Note that the terminal waypoints are still included in the NDB and can be used for flight plan purpose. The limitation is in the display on the ND. Indeed the removed terminal waypoints can NOT be displayed on the EFIS upon selection of the WAYPOINTS option on the Efis Control Panel because not included in the hash table. but once again it is only a display limit upon selection of option on EFIS CP and no other limitation for operation. The limitation exists as soon as the NDB size exceeds 1.3 Meg word / 2.6 MB Note that the new generations of Pegasus FMS (using a new NDB format : called Flex) have a capability of 20 Mbytes. This new FMS is currently in service on A320 and will enter into service on Long Range (A330/A340 by Q2 2012). This format has no practical limitation (compared to the above one).
