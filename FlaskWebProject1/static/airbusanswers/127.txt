The battery located in the Pegasus FM cardset are Lithium Battery. The regulations (valid end of 2008) require to declare such equipment as dangerous goods depending on the quantity of Lithium contained in the equipment. Since the battery used by the FM cardset does not exceed the limit required, there is no reason to declare the FM cardset as dangerous goods. However the battery itself are shipped, declared and labeled as dangerous goods.
