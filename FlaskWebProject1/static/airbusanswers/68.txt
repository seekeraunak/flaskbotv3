The current version of A380 FMS software (L2 and L2.1 ) is only capable of storing 20 Pilot created NAvaid and 50 pilot created waypoints. The Pilot Ellement list stored pilot manually created Latitude Longitude, Place/bearing/distance, place/bearing/place/bearing waypoints. If the Pilot Ellement List already contains 50 waypoints and/or 20 navaids waypoints and they are either Defined or IN USE (i.e. in either the Primary or a Secondary flight plan) then no further Lat / Long waypoints can be Uplinked or Entered. If the Pilot Ellement List contains 10 waypoints in use by the FMS then a further 40 Lat / Long waypoints can be uplinked / entered. The pilots can delete waypoints stored in the Pilot Ellement List by: DATA/PILOT WAYPOINT page On transition to done if the AMI option CO ROUTE DETENTION is deactivated Once a new NDB is uploaded or a new cycle is swapped A waypoint can only be deleted if its not in use. If a waypoint in the Pilot Ellement List is not in use by the FMS then an Uplnked waypoint can automatically replace it in the list.
