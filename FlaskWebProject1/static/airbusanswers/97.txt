When the FMS has been powered off for a "very long time", all the RAM is erased and as such the FMS is not able to know the last IRS alignment reference (time and position). This reference is needed to compute the drift; if no new alignment is performed before the flight, the FMS displays dashes after landing. The FMS defines the starting time for drift computation as the time at which the IRS transitions from "waiting for alignment" or "in alignment" to "in navigation".
