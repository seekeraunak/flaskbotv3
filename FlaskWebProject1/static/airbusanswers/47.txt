The LSBM is an Airbus system. This error is a known error and its okay to keep moving forward with the software loading procedures. The software will still load the Honeywell systems on the aircraft. On the A380 and A350, Airbus has developed a tool to check loadable element (vs security check – A665 compliance). Before that ARINC 665 was not constraining for the software we deliver. The Tool that generates the warning is from Airbus. The aim is mainly to ensure security/integrity of the software form the open world to the aircraft domain. Why is this warning generated? Because we are not compliant to A665 for the Nav DB PN and we believe the tool has been developed to also perform compliance check with A665 rules. I’m not aware of any changes to the part number structure in the near future.
