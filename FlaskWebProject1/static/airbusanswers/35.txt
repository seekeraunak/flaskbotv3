A RESYNC occurs when the MASTER FM (Flight Management) syncronizes with the SLAVE FM. A "PLEASE WAIT" message is displayed on both Multifunction Control Display Units (MCDU's) and a "MAP NOT AVAIL" message is displayed on the Nav Display (ND). This could take up to 30 Seconds. A RESET occurs if there are three unsuccessful RESYNC's within a one minute period. This results in a restart of the operational software. If it is a single RESET, then normal operation will continue after the event. If it is a dual RESET, then there would be a loss of all pilot entered data, including the flight plan.
