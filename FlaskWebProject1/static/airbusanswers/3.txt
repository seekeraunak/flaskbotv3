One operator asked how could they verify the contents of the FMS OPC of their A320’s. All their A319/A320/A321 airplanes had FM Operational software Step 1A P/N: PS4087600-903, but different FMC OPC’s. They also asked if the FM OPTIONS CONFIG is the same thing as the FMS OPC or part of it.   FM options config is the same as OPC. There are 2 main ways to define customization at FM level:   - OPC which is controlled by Airbus and Operator. It reflects operational option and A/C installation. -   AMI which is a set of FM software option defined by the operator.   We don’t have the content of each OPC P/N since it is controlled by Airbus and operator. However customer can print the OPC content through the MCDU and they will get the OPC content. This print capability is a new feature of Step1A on A320 (FM Ops 4087600-903).   You can print the FMS OPC contents by performing the following actions in the aircraft’s Multipurpose Control and Display Unit (MCDU):   NOTE 1: Before performing any kind of work in the airplane, firstly read the airplane’s AMM in order to know how to get the system pages in the MCDU.   NOTE 2: The information described below is for information only. Any task performed in the aircraft has to be done according to the airplane’s AMM.   - In the MCDU Main Menu page, p ush the line key adjacent to FMGC. - In the FMGC page, p ush the line key adjacent to SOFTWARE STATUS/XLOAD. - In the P/N XLOAD page, p ush the line key adjacent to NEXT PAGE and cycle the pages until you find the FM OPTIONS CONFIG page. - In the FM OPTIONS CONFIG page, p ush the line key adjacent to PRINT. - Get the print of the FMS OPC (FM OPTIONS CONFIG) in the cockpit’s printer. - Return to the MCDU Main Menu page.   NOTE 3: The printing capability of AMI and OPC exists on both A320 and A330/A340 Step1A. However Step1A on LR is optional and only a few number of customers have it at the moment.
