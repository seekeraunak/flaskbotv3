The Wind uplinks are limited to 100 winds on Pegasus FMS (step 1 on A320, P1, P2 or P3 for A340) and also Legacy FMS. It means that you can uplink 1 wind/alt for 100 waypoints or 4 winds on 25 waypoints. It is the software limit (based on the memory allocation required and allowed). There is also the limit on the wind uplink message itself that can limit the number of winds depending of the number of characters used for the waypoints ident. This limit is 1255 usefull characters (+4 for the CRC at the end of the message per Arinc 702). On Pegasus Step 1A, the limit in term of wind number that can be uplinked is increased to 182. Note also that the FM will propagate winds forward from each cruise waypoint; thus, it is not necessary to uplink wind data for every waypoint in the cruise phase if there are no changes between them.
