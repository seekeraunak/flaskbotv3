The auto population (Flight plan stringing) post processing / activation of an FMS Flight Plan uplink containing a port where assocaited alternate company route data is encoded is per Airbus design. The Airbus specification requires that if a preferred alternate is defined in the A380 NDB, it is automatically strung in the flight plan (if several are coded for a port then the closest is used and the first altn route assocaited). A manual entry of an FMS flight plan will produce the same result.
