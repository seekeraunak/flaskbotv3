Firstly, the term "RNP Hold" is a red herring. For our Airbus FMCs, then none of the FMCs have made any changes to support the RNP Hold concept. But our Boeing FMCs have. Specifically, on the B777 then the FMC supports the DO 236A concept of hold containment. Our Boeing FMCs do not support Data Base Holds. But if a Hold is strung into the F-PLN as part of a procedure then the B777 FMC will extract any RNP value for that Hold from the NDB. This RNP value does not change the construction of the Hold but the normal ANP v RNP rules apply.
