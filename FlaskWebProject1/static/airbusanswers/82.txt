Yes there is. The first FM kit hardware PN 4084070-901 has been modified into -902 to prevent upon issue with OPS software upload. Prior to any retrofit, it is recommended to send the FM cardset to Honeywell to implement this modification. This Mod is FOC and is systematically proposed to the customer when -901 is received in the shop for any other concern. Honeywell SB C21-3641-515 (ATA 4084070-34-0004)
