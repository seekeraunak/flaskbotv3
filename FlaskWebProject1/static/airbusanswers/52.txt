It has been observed that while carrying out the S/B with a PDL (Portable Data Loader) manufactured by “DEMO SYSTEM” the aircraft could not recognize that the PDL was hooked up even though the PDL was powered up. Fortunately we also had a Honeywell (Allied Signals) PDL on hand. Once the Honeywell loader was hooked up, the loading was carried out without any problems. The problems seen with the DEMO SYSTEM PDL were also observed during a previous attempt on another aircraft and another PDL. Customer confirmed that the DEMO SYSTEM PDL was used previously to do the FMS update and also used on SAT COM system without any issues. So if you encounter this problem try to locate a Honeywell PDL to carry out the core upgrade.
