For wind requests in the Climb phase of flight, the CQ portion of the downlink message automatically includes the altitude at the first T/C (Top of Climb) point. The WQ (cruise) portion of the wind request automatically includes wind altitudes as follows: 1) If any altitudes are displayed on the MCDU CRUISE WIND page, the flight levels displayed on that page are included with the downlink. 2) If no altitude is displayed on the MCDU CRUISE WIND page, but a cruise flight level exists from a pilot-entry, that cruise flight level and the first 3 step flight levels on the STEP page are included with the downlink. 3) Otherwise, no wind altitudes are included with the downlink. The DQ (descent) portion of the wind request automatically includes the altitude of the final cruise flight level in the flight plan. The Winds UPLINK from the airlines AOC server may respond with different wind / altitude data than requested by the pilot. Thus any investigation of wind uplinks not included data requested by the pilot require analysis of the aircraft's ACARS traffic logs.
